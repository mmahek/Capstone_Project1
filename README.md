# 🩺 AI Public Health Assistant

*A Context-Aware, Bilingual Health Chatbot with Environmental Intelligence*

---

## 📌 Overview

AI Public Health Assistant is a **Django-based intelligent health chatbot** designed to provide **context-aware, safe, and non-diagnostic health guidance**.

Unlike traditional health bots, this system integrates:

* 🧠 Machine Learning (disease prediction)
* 🌍 Environmental risk analysis
* 📊 Symptom severity classification
* 🌐 Bilingual interaction (Hindi + English)
* 🔐 Privacy-first design

The system is inspired by our **patent proposal** focusing on **environment-aware public health intelligence**.

### 🧠 Machine Learning Prediction

* Model: **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression**
* Input: Natural language symptoms (e.g., "fever and headache")
* Output:

  * Predicted disease
  * Confidence score

---

### 🌍 Environmental Risk Intelligence

* Uses:

  * Temperature 🌡️
  * Humidity 💧
  * Air Quality Index (AQI) 🌫️
* Provides contextual risk like:

  * Respiratory risk
  * Heat/dehydration risk

---

### 📊 Symptom Severity Classification

* Rule-based severity levels:

  * 🟢 Low
  * 🟡 Moderate
  * 🔴 High
* Ensures **safe, non-diagnostic guidance**

---

### 🌐 Bilingual Support

* Supports:

  * English 🇬🇧
  * Hindi 🇮🇳
